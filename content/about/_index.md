#### We're run by our members
We have no staff. We're a bunch of people who want a space like this to exist, and so we've made it exist.

We have a board of 5 people who pay the bills and keep the space in good standing legally. They're also the people who can deal with any issues within the space.

There are regular meetings, where discussion can occur. We have a lively group chat.


## Our Culture
