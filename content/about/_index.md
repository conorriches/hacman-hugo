## Our aim
> A space for people who make things to make things

## How it works
{{< badge "success" >}}170+ members{{< /badge >}}
{{< badge "warning" >}}5 board members{{< /badge >}}
{{< badge "danger" >}}No staff{{< /badge >}}
{{< badge "secondary" >}}Everyone pays at least Â£12.50 a month{{< /badge >}}

## We're run by our members
We have no staff. We're a bunch of people who want a space like this to exist, and so we've made it exist.

We have a [board](/about/board) of 5 people who pay the bills and keep the space in good standing legally. They're also the people who can deal with any issues within the space.

There are regular meetings, where discussion can occur. We have a lively group chat.

## We communicate
We have three main ways of staying in touch:

#### In person
On the first Monday of every other month (Feb, April, June, August, October, December) at 19:30 we have our regular [meeting](/about/meetings)., there's an agenda and all minutes are [uploaded](/about/meetings).

We also have game nights regularly.

#### On the forum
We have our [forum](https://list.hacman.org.uk) where anyone, member or not, can post topics for others to see. The system acts as an email list too so it reaches more people.

#### In group chats
We have an official group chat, on the chat app (Telegram)[https://t.me/hacmanchester].
There are also other groups for different areas.

## Our Culture
