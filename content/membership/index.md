## Pay what the space is worth to you
We ask you pay what you can - we're a non-profit and any profit that is made goes right back into the space.

There is no discrimination so whatever you pay will get you the same access and rights as anyone else, but of course the more you pay the more you support the space.

| Level           | Amount     | Access                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Recommended** | **£25.00** | **Full access, pays the bills, supports the space.**                                     |
| Minimum         | £12.50     | Full access, helps towards paying the bills.                                             |
| What you want   | £??.??     | Full access, the more you choose to give the more that gets invested back into the space |

Payments can be changed or cancelled at any time. We use a third part payment processor (GoCardless) to collect dues on our behalf. If you prefer you can pay by standing order.

## Keys to the space
We use an RFID-tag access sytem so there's no metal keys. 
We sell RFID tags for £2 that you can use but you're welcome to use a valid tag you may already have - this can be a smartcard or existing tag.

To get your tag set up:
* [Join](https://members.hacman.org.uk/) the space using our simple online form.
* To get 24/7 access, you need a tag. A smartcard will work or you can use an existing RFID tag. We also sell tags for £2. 
* To link a tag to your account, come to the space, log into your account on our registration kiosk and then tap your tag onto the reader.
