It's one of our most popular tools that can be used to make many number of things. 

* The cutting area is 600 x 400 mm (A2)
* You can cut material up to around 6mm thick

This tool requires training, and there are a group of laser trainers who can do that.
There are also, separately, a group of laser maintainers who have been trained to fix it.


### Usage
{{< alert danger >}} 
If the laser cutter does anything out of the ordinary please make sure it's reported to a laser maintainer.
<br/>
 If the response is "please put the out of order sign on the cutter" then do that. <br/>
 <b>DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FIX THE CUTTER YOURSELF</b>. 
 <br/>If it is clearly not functioning, put the out of order sign on it and then report it. We will fix it as soon as possible.
