We have two 3D printers for use within the hackspace:
### Mendel90
This is the general usage 3D printer. Its reliable, needs minimal maintenance, and will print PLA or ABS. If you're just starting out, you want to use this printer.


#### How to print
-   Place 3D object onto the Cura platform, rotate and scale it however you need. You can place multiple items on the bed if you need to print multiple things. It's a good idea to leave a few millimetres gap around the edge of the platform, just in case.
-  Check the above settings and profile are loaded into Cura.
- If you're happy with the print time and amount of filament it'll use, export the toolpath to a location on your computer.
-  Browse to either http://mendel90/ or http://m90.hacman.org.uk/ in your browser and log in to Octoprint using the details provided next to the printer itself.
- Load the .gcode toolpath file.
- Clear the printing bed of any other items.
- Click print!

Make sure you watch your print for a good duration at the start so you can stop any problems that happen, such as the filament not sticking to the heated bed.

You can also watch your print using the control tab in Octoprint.
 #### Stopping a print

Hit the stop button in Octoprint.
Under the control tab, hit the home buttons under both the X/Y and Z columns.
Recover your print from the bed.
### MendelMax
This printer is a bit more finicky, and recommended for advanced users only.
